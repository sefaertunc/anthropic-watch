## The 70% Rule

Context windows are finite. When you estimate you've used roughly 70% of available
context, it's time to act. Don't wait until you're out of room — you lose the ability
to reason well before you hit the hard limit.

Signs you're running low:

- You've read many large files in this session
- You've had a long back-and-forth conversation
- You're working on a second or third major task
- Responses are getting slower or less coherent

## Three Tools, Different Jobs

### /compact — Compress and continue

Use when: you're mid-task and need more room but want to keep working.
What it does: summarizes conversation history, freeing context.
Pair with: PostCompact hook that re-reads CLAUDE.md and PROGRESS.md automatically.

After compaction, always re-orient:

- What task am I working on?
- What branch am I on?
- What did I just do?

### /clear — Fresh start

Use when: you're starting a genuinely new task with no relationship to the current one.
What it does: wipes conversation entirely.
Caution: you lose ALL context. Make sure PROGRESS.md is updated first.

### Subagents — Offload without losing context

Use when: a side task would pollute your main context (research, testing, file generation).
What it does: spawns a separate context that does work and returns results.
Your main context stays clean.

## Decision Matrix

| Situation                                   | Action                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| ~70% context, mid-task                      | /compact                 |
| Task complete, starting unrelated work      | /clear                   |
| Need to research something tangential       | Subagent                 |
| Need to run tests while continuing design   | Subagent                 |
| Context feels sluggish, responses degrading | /compact                 |
| Long debugging session, found the fix       | /compact, then implement |

## PostCompact Hook

The workflow installs a PostCompact hook that runs:

```
cat CLAUDE.md && cat docs/spec/PROGRESS.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

> On Windows, this command runs in Git Bash (installed with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org)).

This ensures you never lose your bearings after compaction. The hook fires
automatically — you don't need to re-read these files manually.

## Session Persistence

The workflow automatically maintains session continuity:

### SessionStart Hook (automatic)

When a new Claude Code session opens, a hook automatically injects:

- CLAUDE.md — project conventions and rules
- PROGRESS.md — current project state
- The most recent session summary from `.claude/sessions/`

You don't need to manually re-read these. The hook handles it.
Use /start for additional context (handoff files, agent routing).

### Session Summaries

Session summaries are written to `.claude/sessions/` by:

- `/commit-push-pr` — writes a summary before committing (completed work)
- `/end` — writes a summary before the handoff commit (in-progress work)

These are local files (gitignored) that bridge the gap between sessions.
They're automatically picked up by the next session's SessionStart hook.

### The Continuity Chain

```
Session 1: work → /commit-push-pr → writes session summary → push
Session 2: SessionStart hook → reads summary → knows what happened → /start for extras
```

If the session summary is missing or stale, /start still reads PROGRESS.md
and handoff files as fallback. The system degrades gracefully.

## Hook Profiles

Control which hooks fire via the `WORCLAUDE_HOOK_PROFILE` environment variable:

| Profile    | Hooks Active                    | Use When                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `minimal`  | SessionStart, PostCompact only  | Exploring, learning, minimal overhead |
| `standard` | All hooks (default)             | Normal development                    |
| `strict`   | All hooks + TypeScript checking | Pre-release, team CI, maximum safety  |

Set in your shell:

```bash
export WORCLAUDE_HOOK_PROFILE=minimal   # lightweight
export WORCLAUDE_HOOK_PROFILE=standard  # default (same as unset)
export WORCLAUDE_HOOK_PROFILE=strict    # maximum enforcement
```

Or per-session:

```bash
WORCLAUDE_HOOK_PROFILE=strict claude
```

The default is `standard` if the variable is not set. You don't need to do
anything for normal development — the default just works.

## Token Budgets (Reference)

Approximate values from Claude Code v2.1.88 source (March 2026). These may change between releases.

| Resource                                       | Budget                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Context window (default)                       | 200,000 tokens                                         |
| Context window (Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.6 with 1M) | 1,000,000 tokens                                       |
| Max output tokens (Sonnet 4.6)                 | 32,000 default, 128,000 upper limit                    |
| Max output tokens (Opus 4.6)                   | 64,000 default, 128,000 upper limit                    |
| Tool presence overhead                         | ~500 tokens (added when any tools are enabled)         |
| Post-compact file restore                      | 5 files max, 50,000 token budget, 5,000 per file       |
| Post-compact skills restore                    | 25,000 token budget, 5,000 per skill                   |
| Compact summary output                         | 20,000 tokens max                                      |
| CLAUDE.md total budget                         | ~40,000 characters across all loaded instruction files |
| MEMORY.md (native, ~/.claude/)                 | 200 lines / 25,000 bytes                               |

Practical takeaways:

- After compaction, only 5 files are restored at 5k tokens each. Structure your work
  so the most important files are recently read.
- Skills over 5k tokens get truncated after compaction. Keep skills focused.
- The 70% rule still applies — these numbers help you estimate when you'll hit it.

## Context Budget Tiers

Monitor your context usage and adjust behavior accordingly:

| Tier      | Context Free | Behavior                                                 |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| PEAK      | >75%         | Normal operation — read files freely, keep full context  |
| GOOD      | 50-75%       | Be selective about file reads — summarize large files    |
| DEGRADING | 25-50%       | Summarize before reading new files, consider /compact    |
| CRITICAL  | <25%         | Save state immediately, /compact, reload only essentials |

Heuristics (you cannot measure exact tokens):

- Many large file reads in this session = likely DEGRADING
- Long conversation with multiple tasks = likely DEGRADING
- Just started or just compacted = likely PEAK

## Gotchas

- Compacting doesn't free as much context as you think. If you've read 20 large files,
  compaction helps but won't get you back to fresh. Consider /clear if the task is done.
- Subagents don't share your conversation context. They start fresh. Give them explicit
  instructions and file paths — don't assume they know what you know.
- Don't compact right before a complex merge or refactor. You'll lose the nuanced
  understanding of the changes you've been building up.
- After /compact, always verify your understanding before making changes. The summary
  may have lost important details.
