description: "Commit, push, and create PR — branch-aware with session summary"
---

Determine which branch you're on, then follow the appropriate flow.
Do not add Co-Authored-By trailers or AI-generated footers to commits or PR descriptions.

## Worktree Awareness

If you are in a git worktree session:

- Verify you are on the correct branch: `git branch --show-current`
- All changes must be committed before creating a PR — `git status --porcelain` should be empty after staging
- Do NOT attempt to switch branches inside a worktree — each worktree is locked to its branch

## On a feature branch (feature/_, fix/_, chore/_, refactor/_)

Feature branches contain ONLY the task changes. Do NOT touch shared-state
files (see git-conventions.md for the canonical list).

1. Write a session summary to .claude/sessions/:
   - Filename: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-{short-branch-name}.md
   - Content format:

     ```
     # Session: {date}
     **Branch:** {current branch}
     **Task:** {one-line summary of what was worked on}

     ## Completed
     - {what was done, 3-5 bullet points}

     ## Files Modified
     - {list key files changed, from git diff --name-only}

     ## Notes for Next Session
     - {anything the next session should know}

     ## Workflow Observability
     - **Agents invoked:** {ALL agents used this session — explicit @agent calls AND agents invoked implicitly by commands like /verify, /review-plan, /refactor-clean. Write "none" if no agents were used.}
     - **Commands used:** {all slash commands run earlier in this session, e.g. /start, /verify, /refactor-clean. Do NOT include the current /commit-push-pr or /end that is writing this summary. Write "none" if no other commands were used.}
     - **Verification result:** {if /verify was run: passed/failed with brief summary; otherwise "not run".}
     ```

   - Keep it concise — this is for machine consumption at session start,
     not a detailed report

2. Stage all changes: git add -A
3. Write a clear, conventional commit message
4. Push to the current branch
5. Create a PR targeting develop: gh pr create --base develop
6. Include in PR description: title, changes, testing done, reviewer notes

## On develop

Only used for release merges after /sync has been run.

1. Write a session summary to .claude/sessions/:
   - Filename: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-{short-branch-name}.md
   - Same format as the feature branch session summary above
2. Stage all changes: git add -A
3. Write a clear, conventional commit message
4. Push to develop
5. Create a PR targeting main: gh pr create --base main

## On any other branch

Ask the user which base branch to target before creating a PR.

Use gh pr create for PR creation.

## Trigger Phrases

- "commit and push"
- "create a PR"
- "ship it"
- "push my changes"
